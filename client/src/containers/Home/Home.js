<p className="review"> "This place has their own roaster who roasts a proprietary blend just for their business!  In a word, all of their coffee is phenomenal !  The atmosphere is relaxing and I jokingly say my office is in the corner on the right.  I spend so much time there people actually get up and move if I enter the shop.  If you want to know what Mount Holly is really like, this is the place to come.  All educational, economic, religious, social groups come her and blend together!  It's more than coffee...it is a place you can say is more like home, than home!"</p>
